<h3 align="center">eBay Completed Items API</h3>


---

<p align="center"> This API is used to receive data on recently sold eBay listings by scraping eBay.com
Refine the request by filtering by keywords, excluded phrases, category, and aspect values. Aspect values are category-specific parameters used to search for more precise products. For example: model, condition, carrier, storage.
You will receive the number of total results, the average price of all products searched for, the minimum price, the maximum price, and the price and more information on each individual product.

## üîß Troubleshooting <a name = "troubleshooting"></a>

#### Long request time
If you've noticed that every once in a while your requests will take well over 10 seconds, there is a reason for that. eBay requires a captcha to be solved every few hours when requesting data for sold items. When our server detects a captcha is required, it will automatically solve it and send you the results for the data once it is available, but this can take a few seconds to complete. A captcha is only required once every few hours, but should not affect the success rate or results of the data.

#### Aspects
Some aspects on eBay have a different url value then what is shown on the site. If the aspect is not working, make sure that aspect can be used with the category you have selected. Then visit the response_url and select the aspect you want shown. Navigate to the url bar and look for a substring where the new aspect was updated. For example eBay shows "condition" as one of the aspect names, but the actual value in the url is "LH_ItemCondition", and the valeus are condition id's and not condition names.

#### Conditions
Conditions on eBay have correlated ids. These ids can be found here: https://developer.ebay.com/devzone/finding/callref/enums/conditionIdList.html
Not all conditions work for every category. Make sure you visit the response_url to see what aspects you can use.
